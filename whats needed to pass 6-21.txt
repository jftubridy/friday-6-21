Good work! You're closer than you think. Continue working on this and resubmit by Monday July 1st.

The main thing I see is input from the user is coming in undefined. 
Work on that first and the rest of the application might fall into place better. 
You got your size coming in as a string and toppings coming in as an array. 
Check that the input is correct by using console.log().

Also remember that your var customPizza is an object that has size and toppings as properties. 
So if you want to get the size the user selected then it would be customPizza.size.

What you need to do to pass: 1) Application works as expected with required functionality. Don't worry about styling. 
2) Make a ReadMe

Let me know if you want to meet to go cover any object concepts.
